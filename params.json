{"name":"DistArray","tagline":"NumPy-like distributed arrays, ufuncs, and more.  Think globally, act locally.","body":"DistArray\r\n=========\r\n\r\n*Think globally, act locally.*\r\n\r\nDistArray provides general multidimensional NumPy-like distributed arrays to\r\nPython.  It intends to bring the strengths of NumPy to data-parallel\r\nhigh-performance computing.  DistArray has a similar API to [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).\r\n\r\nDistArray is ready for real-world testing and deployment; however, the project\r\nis still evolving rapidly, and we appreciate continued input from the\r\nscientific-Python community.\r\n\r\nDistArray is for users who\r\n\r\n* know and love Python and NumPy,\r\n* want to scale NumPy to larger distributed datasets,\r\n* want to interactively play with distributed data but also\r\n* want to run batch-oriented distributed programs;\r\n* want an easier way to drive and coordinate existing MPI-based codes,\r\n* have a lot of data that may already be distributed,\r\n* want a global view (\"think globally\") with local control (\"act locally\"),\r\n* need to tap into existing parallel libraries like Trilinos, PETSc, or\r\n  Elemental,\r\n* want the interactivity of IPython and the performance of MPI.\r\n\r\nDistArray is designed to work with other packages that implement the\r\n[Distributed Array Protocol](http://distributed-array-protocol.readthedocs.org).\r\n\r\nPlease see our documentation at [Read the Docs](http://distarray.readthedocs.org) (or in the `docs` directory) for\r\nmore, join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/distarray), or chat with us on #distarray on freenode.\r\nPull requests gladly accepted.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
